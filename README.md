Magma code related to the paper "Cartan images and *l*-torsion points of elliptic curves with rational *j*-invariant," by Oron Y. Propp.

This code depends on modules by Andrew V. Sutherland related to his paper "[Computing images of Galois representations attached to elliptic curves](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/fms.2015.33)." They may be downloaded [here](http://math.mit.edu/~drew/galrep/).
